# trainlocator-cta-ios

WIP iOS app. To use this app, you will need to [request an API key from the CTA](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintracker/).

Replace the empty "key" string in DataDecoder.swift (line 13) with your key.

TODO: 
- add semaphores when parsing JSON
- add error handling when no predictions are generated
- fix AutoLayout issues

Deployment target: iOS 13.2
This project is neither made nor endorsed by CTA
